## About

The goal of this project is to provide interactive stories for language
learners. Basic knowledge of the target language is needed.

Each story includes a transcript, audio, and translations. Click on any sentence
to see the translation. There are also choices to make, images to collect, and
minigames to complete.

## Free and Collaborative

This website is free and contains no ads. The texts are published under a
Creative Commons license. The source code is available.

The goal is to create a community of contributors to write and translate stories
in many languages. The list of languages is very limited now, but you can
request a new language and help with translations.

The project is still at an early stage, please give some feedback.
