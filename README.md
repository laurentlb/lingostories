I've written language-learning tips at https://lingostories.org/guide.html.

## About

The goal of this project is to provide interactive stories for language learners
(like a "choose-your-own-adventure"). Basic knowledge of the target language is
needed.

Reading is an effective ways to acquire a language, as it exposes learners to
new vocabulary, grammar structures, and cultural nuances in context. By engaging
with interactive stories, learners can immerse themselves in a narrative while
practicing comprehension and decision-making in the target language.

## Features

- Interactive stories with multiple choices. It remembers what you did (e.g. there's an inventory).
- Read sentence by sentence, at your own pace.
- Learning Modes
  * Listening & Reading Mode: Simultaneous audio and text.
  * Listening Mode: Focus on audio comprehension; check the transcript afterwards if needed.
  * Reading Mode: Text-only learning.
- Translations: available in multiple languages, click on a sentence to see its translation.
- Minigames (optional): put the words in the right order (helps you practice listening)
- Images to collect: it's a gamification that encourages you to replay the story
  to try other branches.
- AI-powered explanations: for some sentences, you can see a breakdown of the sentence and learn grammatical subtleties.
- Speech recognition: try pronouncing the sentence out loud in your microphone (experimental API - doesn't work on every browser).

The project is still at an early stage, feedback is welcome. Contributions are
