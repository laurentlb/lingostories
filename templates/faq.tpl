            <p>
                While reading the story in {language}, you'll make choices, similar to the format of
                Choose Your Own Adventure books. This makes the experience more
                engaging, encourages you to replay stories with different
                outcomes, and adds variety to the learning process.

            <p>
                Yes. LingoStories is 100% free. There are no ads, no account to create, no
                arbitrary limitations. The texts are published under a Creative

                <summary><h2>How many stories are there?</h2></summary>
            <p>
                Currently, there are only two stories:
                <ul>
                <li> <span class="news-title">A Day in the Park</span>: A simple story created as a
                proof-of-concept for the website.
                <li> <span class="news-title">The Grocery List</span>: A more interactive story that remembers
                the choices and includes an inventory of items.
                </ul>
                More stories will be added over time, and we aim to create more
                complex and engaging stories in the future.

                <summary><h2>How can stories help me learn a language?</h2></summary>
            <p>
                Stories provide natural, engaging context for language learning.
                By reading or listening to stories in {language}, you encounter new vocabulary
                and grammar in meaningful situations. Stories also make learning
                enjoyable and help improve your comprehension and listening
                skills.

            <p>
                We welcome contributions! Our goal is to create a <a
                href="/doc/contributing.html">community of contributors</a>
                to write and translate stories in many languages. The list of
                languages is still limited now, but you can <a
                href="https://forms.gle/9djaTH25wUN74psm8">request a new
                language</a> and assist with translations.

            <p>
                <ul>
                <li>Stories are imagined and written by contributors.
                <li>Translations are also made by volunteers. We have found that automated translations can't
                    provide the expected level of quality we aim for.
                <li>Voices are generated using text-to-speech software. Recording high quality voices can be difficult
                    or expensive, and would make it difficult to update a story in the future. However, this can be considered
                    if someone is willing to provide recordings or pay for a professional voice actors. Let us know how
                    important this is to you.
                </ul>
                <li>Illustrations are generated using AI. We'll replace them if anyone volunteers to make graphics.

                Content is created by volunteers on their free time. For this reason, we cannot commit to any timeline.
