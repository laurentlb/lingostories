            <p>
                LingoStories is a free platform that offers interactive stories
                for language learners. The stories use simple vocabulary and
                grammar to help you practice your language skills in a fun and
                engaging way. You can listen to the audio, read the text in your
                target language, and check the translation when needed. The
                stories are available in multiple languages, and you can
                customize the settings to match your learning style.</p>

                <summary><h2>How do interactive stories work?</h2></summary>
            <p>
                During the story, you'll make choices, similar to the format of
                Choose Your Own Adventure books. This makes the experience more
                engaging, encourages you to replay stories with different
                outcomes, and adds variety to the learning process.

            <p>

                arbitrary limitations. The texts are published under a Creative

                <summary><h2>How many stories are there?</h2></summary>
            <p>
                Currently, there are only two stories:
                <ul>
                <li> A Day in the Park: A simple story created as a
                proof-of-concept for the website.
                <li> The Grocery List: A more interactive story that remembers
                the choices and includes an inventory of items.
                </ul>
                More stories will be added over time, and we aim to create more
                complex and engaging stories in the future.

                <summary><h2>How can stories help me learn a language?</h2></summary>
            <p>
                Stories provide natural, engaging context for language learning.
                By reading or listening to stories, you encounter new vocabulary
                and grammar in meaningful situations. Stories also make learning
                enjoyable and help improve your comprehension and listening
                skills through repeated exposure to the language.
