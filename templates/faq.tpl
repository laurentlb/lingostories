            <p>
                While reading the story in {language}, you'll make choices, similar to the format of
                Choose Your Own Adventure books. This makes the experience more
                engaging, encourages you to replay stories with different
                outcomes, and adds variety to the learning process.

                <summary><h2>How many stories are there?</h2></summary>
            <p>
                Currently, there are only two stories:
                <ul>
                <li> <span class="news-title">A Day in the Park</span>: A simple story created as a
                proof-of-concept for the website.
                <li> <span class="news-title">The Grocery List</span>: A more interactive story that remembers
                the choices and includes an inventory of items.
                </ul>
                More stories will be added over time, and we aim to create more
                complex and engaging stories in the future.
