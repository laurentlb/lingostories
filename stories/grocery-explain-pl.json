    "onthemains-719c": "## Translation:  \n\"On the main square, a group of tourists is taking photos of the old buildings.\"\n\n## Breakdown:  \n- \"Na głównym placu\" - \"Na\" means \"on,\" \"głównym\" is an adjective meaning \"main\" in the instrumental case, and \"placu\" is \"square\" in the instrumental case, indicating location.\n- \"grupa turystów\" - \"grupa\" means \"group,\" and \"turystów\" is the genitive plural form of \"turysta,\" meaning \"tourists.\" The use of genitive here indicates that the tourists belong to the group.\n- \"robi zdjęcia\" - \"robi\" is the third person singular form of \"robić,\" meaning \"to take/make.\" \"zdjęcia\" is the plural form of \"zdjęcie,\" which means \"photo\" or \"picture.\" \n- \"starych budynków\" - \"starych\" is the genitive plural form of \"stary,\" meaning \"old,\" and \"budynków\" is \"buildings\" in the genitive plural, used here to specify what photos are being taken of.\n\n## General Notes:  \nThe sentence uses the genitive case to indicate possession (group of tourists, old buildings). This construction is common in Polish when describing relationships between nouns. The instrumental case is also important in the phrase indicating location (\"Na głównym placu\"). \n\n## Rewrite:  \n\"Na rynku, grupa turystów robi zdjęcia starych budynków.\"  \nThis rewritten version replaces \"placu\" with \"rynku,\" which also means \"square\" but can imply a specific market square. The meaning remains similar, but \"rynek\" may connote a more commercial or social gathering space than \"plac.\"",
    "momnoitsim-d5db": "## Translation\n\"No, it's important to have food for dinner. You can play later.\"\n\n## Breakdown\n- \"Nie\" – means \"no,\" indicating disagreement or negation.\n- \"to\" – means \"this,\" referring to the importance mentioned.\n- \"ważne\" – means \"important,\" an adjective that describes the necessity of having food.\n- \"żeby\" – translates to \"to\" or \"in order to,\" introducing a purpose or necessity.\n- \"mieć\" – means \"to have,\" an infinitive verb showing possession.\n- \"coś\" – means \"something,\" a pronoun used to indicate an unspecified object.\n- \"do jedzenia\" – means \"for eating,\" where \"do\" indicates purpose and \"jedzenia\" is the genitive form of \"jedzenie\" (food).\n- \"na kolację\" – translates to \"for dinner,\" with \"na\" indicating purpose and \"kolację\" being the accusative form of \"kolacja\" (dinner).\n- \"możesz\" – means \"you can,\" a second person singular conjugation of \"móc\" (to be able to).\n- \"pobawić się\" – means \"to play,\" where \"pobawić\" is an infinitive verb, and \"się\" is a reflexive pronoun.\n- \"później\" – means \"later,\" an adverb indicating a time reference.\n\n## General Notes\nThe use of \"żeby\" is essential to express purpose in this context, essentially linking the importance of dinner to the action of having food. The phrase \"coś do jedzenia\" is a common way to refer to food in general and captures the idea of having something edible without specifying what it is. \n\n## Rewrite\n\"Nie, ważne jest, aby mieć coś do jedzenia na kolację, możesz się pobawić później.\"\n\nThis rewritten version uses \"ważne jest, aby\" instead of \"to ważne żeby,\" altering the grammatical structure slightly while keeping the same meaning. Both phrases express the importance of having food for dinner, but the rewritten form may sound a bit more formal.",
    "momsurewen-7b14": "## Translation\n\"Sure. We need three tomatoes, four eggs, five apples, and bread.\"\n\n## Breakdown\n- **Oczywiście** - \"Sure\" or \"Of course.\" This word indicates agreement or acknowledgment.\n- **Potrzebujemy** - \"We need.\" It is the first-person plural form of the verb \"potrzebować,\" meaning \"to need.\"\n- **pięciu pomidorów** - \"five tomatoes.\" \"Pięciu\" is the genitive form of \"pięć\" (five), and \"pomidorów\" is the genitive plural of \"pomidor\" (tomato).\n- **cztery jajka** - \"four eggs.\" \"Cztery\" is the nominative form of \"four,\" and \"jajka\" is the nominative plural of \"jajko\" (egg).\n- **pięć jabłek** - \"five apples.\" \"Pięć\" remains in the nominative, and \"jabłek\" is the genitive plural for \"jabłko\" (apple).\n- **i** - \"and.\" A coordinating conjunction used to connect items in a list.\n- **chleb** - \"bread.\" In this context, \"chleb\" is presented as a standalone noun in the nominative case.\n\n## General Notes\nThe original sentence includes a mix of genitive and nominative cases, which is typical when listing quantities of different items in Polish. The genitive case is often used with numbers over two in Polish. The item \"chleb\" is mentioned without a quantity, as it is often considered a staple that doesn't require counting in everyday conversation.\n\n## Rewrite\n\"Z pewnością potrzebujemy pięciu pomidorów, czterech jajek, pięciu jabłek i chleb.\" \nThis version uses \"Z pewnością\" (By certainty) instead of \"Oczywiście,\" adding a level of emphasis on certainty. It also changes \"cztery\" to \"czterech,\" reflecting the genitive case for \"four eggs,\" aligning with typical Polish grammar rules regarding quantities.",

This structure emphasizes the ongoing nature of both actions. \n\n## Rewrite  \n\"Idąc, widzisz dzieci bawiące się w parku.\"  \nThis alternative uses \"idąc,\" which is the gerund of \"iść\" (to go). The difference lies in the nuance— \"przechodząc\" suggests passing by an area, while \"idąc\" implies a more general act of going, potentially without a specific destination.",

The sentence is clear and straightforward, with no idiomatic expressions present.\n\n## Rewrite\n\"Którędy mam iść? Myślę, że teraz muszę skręcić w lewo.\" \n\nThis version includes \"mam iść\" (I have to go), which adds more clarity about the speaker's intention to proceed in a specific direction. It changes the structure slightly by explicitly indicating the action of going, whereas the original sentence directly asks for the way.",
    "teacherill-15f3": "## Translation:\n\"I'll trade you these apples for some pears. Do you have any?\"\n\n## Breakdown:\n- \"Zamienię\" - This is the first person singular future tense form of the verb \"zamienić\", meaning \"to trade\" or \"to exchange\".\n- \"Ci\" - This is the pronoun \"you\" in the dative case, indicating the person receiving the action (the trade).\n- \"te\" - This means \"these\", indicating specificity in the apples being referred to.\n- \"jabłka\" - The plural noun for \"apples\".\n- \"na\" - A preposition meaning \"for\" or \"on\", used here to indicate the purpose of the trade.\n- \"gruszki\" - The plural noun for \"pears\".\n- \"Masz\" - This is the second person singular present tense form of the verb \"mieć\", meaning \"you have\".\n- \"jakieś\" - An indefinite pronoun meaning \"any\", used here to question the existence of pears.\n\n## General Notes:\nThe sentence uses informal language, appropriate for casual conversations. \"Ci\" suggests a familiarity with the person being addressed.

The use of \"żeby\" can indicate intention, making the purpose clear in this context. \n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Nie ma jabłek ani gruszek? Użyję czekoladę, żeby zrobić ciasto czekoladowe.\"\n\nThe rewritten version substitutes \"czekolady\" with \"czekoladę,\" changing it from genitive to accusative case. This modification changes the sentence from stating the ingredient's absence to stating what will be used directly. The meaning remains largely the same, focusing on the action of using chocolate in a recipe.",

The combination of \"właśnie\" and the past tense forms emphasizes the immediacy of the move. The structure reflects typical Polish sentence construction, where the reason follows the main statement.\n\n## Rewrite: \n\"Jesteś nowy w tej wiosce, bo twoja rodzina dopiero co się tutaj przeprowadziła.\"\n\nThis alternative adds \"też\" (this) for specificity regarding which village is being referred to, and uses \"bo\" instead of \"ponieważ,\" making it slightly more informal.

The phrase \"coś dla siebie\" emphasizes the idea of self-purchase or doing something for oneself, which might imply a sense of care or reward.\n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Jeżeli masz wystarczająco monet, możesz kupić coś dla siebie.\"\nThis alternative uses \"jeżeli,\" which is a synonym for \"jeśli\" and slightly more formal.

The use of genitive case with \"owoców i warzyw\" is common in Polish when expressing proximity.\n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Kiedy przybywasz w okolicę owoców i warzyw, dostrzegasz kogoś.\"\nThis version uses \"przybywasz\" (you arrive) instead of \"docierasz,\" which may imply a more formal or intentional arrival. Additionally, \"w okolicę\" means \"in the vicinity,\" providing a slightly broader sense of location compared to \"w pobliże.\" \"Dostrzegasz\" (you notice) substitutes \"rozpoznajesz,\" suggesting a focus on noticing rather than recognizing someone specifically, which can change the nuance of the action.",

Przygotuję sos jabłkowy.\"\n\nThis version translates to \"Great! I also really like apples. I will prepare apple sauce.\" The differences lie in the verbs used; \"bardzo lubię\" (I really like) is less intense than \"uwielbiam\" (I love), and \"przygotuję\" (I will prepare) is a slightly different verb choice that conveys a similar meaning but emphasizes the preparation aspect.",
