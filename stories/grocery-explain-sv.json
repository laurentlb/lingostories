    "onthemains-719c": "## Translation\n\"On the main square, a group of tourists is taking photos of the old buildings.\"\n\n## Breakdown\n- **På**: This means \"on\" and is used to indicate position or location. \n- **stora torget**: \"stora\" means \"main\" or \"large,\" describing the noun \"torget,\" which means \"the square.\" Together, it translates to \"the main square.\"\n- **fotograferar**: This is the verb \"to photograph,\" and in this context, it means \"is taking photos.\" It is in the present tense.\n- **en grupp**: \"en\" is an indefinite article, meaning \"a,\" and \"grupp\" means \"group.\" Together, they translate as \"a group.\"\n- **turister**: This means \"tourists,\" and it is the plural form of \"turist.\"\n- **de gamla byggnaderna**: \"de\" means \"the,\" \"gamla\" means \"old,\" and \"byggnaderna\" is the definite plural form of \"byggnad,\" meaning \"buildings.\" This phrase translates to \"the old buildings.\"\n\n## General Notes\nThe use of the definite form \"byggnaderna\" indicates specific buildings that are already known to the speakers or listeners. The structure of the Swedish sentence follows a subject-verb-object format which is similar to English, making it relatively straightforward for learners.\n\n## Rewrite\n\"Vid det stora torget fotograferar en grupp turister de gamla husen.\"\n\nThis alternative sentence translates to \"At the main square, a group of tourists is taking photos of the old houses.\" It differs in that \"Vid\" means \"at,\" which is a slightly different preposition indicating proximity rather than being directly \"on\" the square. Additionally, \"husen\" translates to \"the houses,\" which may convey a slightly less formal or significant structure compared to \"byggnaderna.\"",
    "momnoitsim-d5db": "## Translation\n\"No, it's important to have food for dinner. You can play later.\"\n\n## Breakdown\n- **Nej**: \"No\" - A straightforward negation used to disagree or refuse.\n- **det är viktigt**: \"it is important\" - \"det\" serves as a placeholder subject; \"viktigt\" means important. This structure is common for expressing importance in Swedish.\n- **att vi får**: \"that we get\" - \"att\" introduces an infinitive clause; \"vi\" means \"we,\" and \"får\" (from the verb \"få\") means \"to get\" or \"to have\" in this context.\n- **mat**: \"food\" - Refers to the sustenance needed for a meal.\n- **till middagen**: \"for dinner\" - \"till\" indicates purpose or destination; \"middagen\" means \"the dinner.\"\n- **Du kan leka**: \"You can play\" - \"Du\" is \"you,\" \"kan\" means \"can\" (indicating ability), and \"leka\" means \"to play.\"\n- **senare**: \"later\" - Indicates a time reference that suggests the action will occur after the current situation.\n\n## General Notes\nThe structure \"det är viktigt att\" is a common way to emphasize the necessity or importance of an action. This sentence's tone suggests a prioritization of responsibility (dinner preparation) over leisure (playing). The use of \"kan\" keeps the tone informal, making it a friendly suggestion rather than a command.\n\n## Rewrite\n\"Nej, vi måste ha mat till middagen. Du kan leka senare.\"\n\nThis alternative translates to: \"No, we must have food for dinner. You can play later.\" The difference lies in the use of \"måste\" (must) instead of \"är viktigt att\" (it is important to), which conveys a stronger sense of obligation compared to simply stating something is important.",
    "momsurewen-7b14": "## Translation:\n\"Sure. We need three tomatoes, four eggs, five apples, and bread.\"\n\n## Breakdown:\n- **Javisst**: This translates to \"Sure\" or \"Of course.\" It expresses agreement or confirmation.\n- **Vi**: Means \"we,\" indicating the subject of the sentence.\n- **behöver**: This is the verb \"need,\" in the present tense, corresponding to the subject \"we.\"\n- **tre tomater**: \"three tomatoes.\" \"tre\" (three) is a numeral, and \"tomater\" (tomatoes) is the plural form of \"tomat\" (tomato).\n- **fyra ägg**: \"four eggs.\" \"fyra\" (four) is also a numeral, and \"ägg\" (eggs) is the plural form of \"ägg\" (egg).\n- **fem äpplen**: \"five apples.\" \"fem\" (five) serves as the numeral, and \"äpplen\" (apples) is the plural form of \"äpple\" (apple).\n- **och**: Means \"and,\" used to connect items in a list.\n- **bröd**: This means \"bread,\" and here it is used in its uncountable form.\n\n## General Notes:\nThe sentence lists several items needed, highlighting the use of numbers to quantify nouns. In Swedish, the plural forms of nouns often undergo a vowel change, as seen with \"tomater,\" \"ägg,\" and \"äpplen.\" The use of \"och\" is standard for combining phrases or items in a list.\n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Javisst. Vi behöver tre tomater, fyra ägg, fem äpplen och ett bröd.\"\n\nThis rewritten version includes \"ett bröd\" (one bread), which indicates a specific quantity. The original uses \"bröd\" in an uncountable sense, while the rewrite suggests a more specific request.",
    "youseechil-9f9b": "## Translation: \n\"You see children playing in the park as you pass by.\"\n\n## Breakdown:\n- **Du**: \"You\" - the informal second-person singular pronoun used for addressing someone directly.\n- **ser**: \"see\" - present tense of the verb \"se,\" meaning to perceive with the eyes.\n- **barn**: \"children\" - the plural form of \"barn,\" used for both singular and plural.\n- **som**: \"who\" / \"that\" - a relative pronoun used to introduce a clause providing more information about \"barn.\"\n- **leker**: \"playing\" - present tense of the verb \"leka,\" meaning to engage in play; \"leker\" is the third-person plural form.\n- **i**: \"in\" - a preposition indicating location.\n- **parken**: \"the park\" - noun in the definite form; \"parken\" is the specific park being referred to.\n- **när**: \"when\" - a conjunction introducing a temporal clause.\n- **du**: \"you\" - repeated for clarity in the dependent clause.\n- **går**: \"pass\" - present tense of the verb \"gå,\" meaning to walk; here, it indicates movement past a location.\n- **förbi**: \"by\" - a preposition denoting movement past something.\n\n## General Notes:\nThe structure of the sentence follows a straightforward subject-verb-object order, typical in Swedish. The phrase \"som leker i parken\" acts as a relative clause describing the children. The use of \"när\" indicates simultaneous actions, which is common in Swedish sentences to show the relationship between events.\n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Du passerar förbi parken och ser barn som leker.\" \nThis rewrite translates to \"You pass by the park and see children playing.\" It differs by changing the order of actions, emphasizing the act of passing by the park first before seeing the children, rather than implying both actions occur simultaneously.",
    "peterwhich-5718": "## Translation\n\"Which way is it? I think I should turn left now.\"\n\n## Breakdown\n- **Vilket**: This translates to \"which,\" used here to ask about a direction. It is an interrogative pronoun.\n- **håll**: Means \"way\" or \"direction.\" In this context, it refers to the direction you should go.\n- **var**: Translates to \"was,\" functioning here as a question word \"is\" in the present tense context.\n- **det**: Means \"it,\" used here to refer to the direction being inquired about.\n- **nu**: Translates to \"now,\" indicating the current moment or time.\n- **Jag tror**: Means \"I think.\" \"Jag\" is \"I\" and \"tror\" is the verb \"think.\"\n- **att**: This is a conjunction meaning \"that,\" often used before an infinitive or clause.\n- **jag borde**: Translates to \"I should.\" \"Borde\" is the past tense of \"böra,\" which means \"should\" or \"ought to.\"\n- **svänga**: This is the infinitive form of the verb \"to turn.\"\n- **vänster**: Means \"left,\" referring to the direction.\n\n## General Notes\nThe phrase \"Vilket håll var det nu?\" captures a conversational, informal query about directions. The combination of \"tror\" and \"borde\" suggests a personal opinion or belief about what should be done. The use of \"nu\" adds an immediacy to the action, indicating that the speaker is considering turning left at the present moment.\n\n## Rewrite\n\"Vilken väg ska jag ta? Jag tänker att jag svänger vänster nu.\"\n\nThis rewrite changes \"håll\" to \"väg\" (road) and uses \"ska\" (will/shall) instead of \"borde,\" which implies a plan rather than a suggestion. It also replaces \"tror\" with \"tänker,\" shifting the phrase from \"I think\" to \"I intend,\" making the speaker's intention clearer.",
    "teacherill-15f3": "## Translation\n\"I'll trade you these apples for some pears. Do you have any?\"\n\n## Breakdown\n- **Jag**: \"I\" - the subject pronoun.\n- **kan**: \"can\" - an auxiliary verb indicating ability or possibility.\n- **byta**: \"trade\" - an infinitive verb meaning to exchange one thing for another.\n- **äpplena**: \"the apples\" - the definite form of \"äpplen\" (apples), indicating specific apples being referred to.

The use of \"byta\" indicates a willingness to engage in mutual exchange, which is a common conversational tactic when negotiating trades. The question \"Har du några?\" is a straightforward way to ask if someone possesses the item being discussed (in this case, pears).\n\n## Rewrite\n\"Jag vill byta de här äpplena mot päron. Har du några?\"  \nThis rewritten version translates to \"I want to trade these apples for pears. Do you have any?\" The difference lies in the expression of desire (\"vill\" translates to \"want\"), which makes the intention clearer but slightly less casual compared to \"kan\" (can).",
    "momnoapple-0262": "## Translation:\n\"No apples or pears? I can use the chocolate to make a chocolate cake.\"\n\n## Breakdown:\n- \"Varken äpplen eller päron?\" - \"Neither apples nor pears?\" \n  - \"Varken\" means \"neither,\" indicating both items are excluded. \n  - \"äpel\" (apples) and \"päron\" (pears) are in plural form, showing that the speaker is referring to these fruits in general.\n- \"Jag kan använda chokladen\" - \"I can use the chocolate\"\n  - \"Jag\" means \"I.\" \n  - \"kan\" translates to \"can,\" indicating ability. \n  - \"använda\" means \"use,\" and \"chokladen\" (the chocolate) is in the definite form, referring to specific chocolate.\n- \"och baka en chokladkaka istället.\" - \"and make a chocolate cake instead.\"\n  - \"och\" means \"and,\" linking the two actions.\n  - \"baka\" means \"to bake.\" \n  - \"en\" means \"a,\" and \"chokladkaka\" (chocolate cake) is a compound word formed from \"choklad\" (chocolate) and \"kaka\" (cake). \n  - \"istället\" translates to \"instead,\" indicating a replacement.\n\n## General Notes:\nThe phrase \"varken ... eller\" is a common way to express neither/nor in Swedish. It highlights the absence of both mentioned items, leading to the alternative presented in the second part of the sentence. The use of \"istället\" emphasizes the substitution being made.\n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Det finns inga äpplen eller päron? Jag kan istället använda chokladen för att baka en chokladkaka.\"\n\nThis rewritten version differs slightly in structure, using \"Det finns inga\" (There are no) instead of \"Varken,\" making it more direct. It also rearranges elements and uses \"för att\" (in order to) for a clearer purpose, maintaining the overall meaning while varying the expression.",
    "andyoustil-5405": "## Translation:\n\"And you still had enough coins to buy something you liked.\"\n\n## Breakdown:\n- **Och**: Means \"and\", used to connect clauses or phrases.\n- **du**: Means \"you\", second-person singular pronoun.\n- **hade**: The past tense of \"ha\", meaning \"had\".\n- **pengar**: Means \"money\" or \"coins\", a plural noun.\n- **överk**: Translates to \"over\", implying surplus or leftover in this context.\n- **till**: Means \"for\" or \"to\", indicating purpose or intention.\n- **något**: Means \"something\", an indefinite pronoun.\n- **som**: Means \"that\" or \"which\", used to introduce a relative clause.\n- **du**: Again, \"you\".\n- **tycker om**: A phrase that means \"like\" or \"to like\", composed of \"tycker\" (think) and \"om\" (about).\n  \n## General Notes:\nThis sentence structure uses past tense to indicate a condition that was true at a previous time. The phrase \"pengar över\" implies having money left after expenses. The expression \"tycker om\" is commonly used in Swedish to express liking for something, unlike saying \"att gilla\", which is more direct.\n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Och du hade kvar pengar till något du gillade.\"\n\nThis rewritten version translates to \"And you had leftover money for something you liked.\" The main difference is the use of \"kvar\" (leftover) instead of \"över\" (surplus) and \"gillade\" (liked) in the past tense instead of \"tycker om\". This change slightly shifts the focus from the ongoing feeling of liking to the fact that the liking was a past preference.",
    "youarenewt-b893": "## Translation:  \nYou are new to the village because your family has just moved here.\n\n## Breakdown:  \n- **Du**: Means \"you.\" It is a pronoun used for addressing someone informally.  \n- **är**: The verb \"are,\" which is the present tense of \"to be.\"  \n- **ny**: Means \"new.\" It describes the state of the subject.  \n- **i**: A preposition that translates to \"in\" or \"to\" depending on the context. Here, it translates to \"to.\"  \n- **den lilla staden**: Means \"the little village.\" \"lilla\" is the diminutive form of \"liten\" (small), used to express endearment or a small size.  \n- **eftersom**: A conjunction that means \"because\" or \"since,\" used to show cause.  \n- **din**: Means \"your,\" a possessive pronoun.  \n- **familj**: Means \"family,\" a noun that refers to a group of related individuals.  \n- **precis har flyttat hit**: \"precis\" means \"just,\" indicating a recent event. \"har flyttat\" is the present perfect tense of \"to move,\" and \"hit\" means \"here,\" indicating a location.\n\n## General Notes:  \nThe sentence uses a standard structure without idiomatic expressions. The verb \"har flyttat\" is notable as it represents an action that has recently been completed, linked to the present. The use of \"lilla\" adds a sense of affection to the description of the village.\n\n## Rewrite:  \n\"Du är ny här i byn eftersom din familj nyligen flyttade hit.\"  \nThis rewritten version uses \"byn\" instead of \"den lilla staden,\" which means \"the village,\" and \"nyligen\" instead of \"precis,\" translating to \"recently.\" The verb \"flyttade\" is in the simple past tense instead of the present perfect tense. This changes the emphasis on timing, making it sound more like the action has been completed rather than ongoing.",
    "momgrandma-f748": "## Translation: \n\"Grandma is visiting us tonight, so we need five apples to make her favorite apple pie.\"\n\n## Breakdown: \n- **Mormor**: Means \"grandma.\" It is an affectionate term for one's mother's mother in Swedish.\n- **kommer på besök**: This phrase means \"is visiting.\" \"Kommer\" is the verb \"to come,\" and \"på besök\" translates to \"for a visit.\" It indicates that the action is happening in the future.\n- **ikväll**: Translates to \"tonight.\" It combines \"i\" (in) and \"kväll\" (evening), specifying the time of the visit.\n- **och**: Means \"and.\" It connects two clauses in the sentence.\n- **vi**: Means \"we.\" It refers to the speaker and at least one other person.\n- **behöver**: Translates to \"need,\" indicating necessity.\n- **äpplen**: Means \"apples.\" It is in the plural form.\n- **för att**: Means \"to\" or \"for the purpose of,\" introducing the reason for needing the apples.\n- **baka**: Means \"to bake.\" It is the verb indicating the action to be performed.\n- **hennes**: Means \"her,\" indicating possession.\n- **favorit**: Means \"favorite.\" It describes something preferred.\n- **äppelpaj**: Means \"apple pie.\" It is a compound word combining \"äpple\" (apple) and \"paj\" (pie).\n\n## General Notes: \nThe sentence uses a straightforward structure typical in Swedish, where the subject-verb-object order is maintained. The phrase \"kommer på besök\" is a common way to express someone is coming to visit.\n\n## Rewrite:\nA possible alternative rewrite could be: \"Mormor kommer hit ikväll, så vi måste ha äpplen för att baka hennes favoritäppelpaj.\" \n\nThis version uses \"kommer hit\" (meaning \"is coming here\") instead of \"kommer på besök,\" which adds more specificity to the location of the visit. Additionally, \"måste ha\" (meaning \"must have\") replaces \"behöver,\" intensifying the necessity for the apples. The meaning is similar, but the wording provides different nuances regarding urgency and location.",
    "momwealson-7f0f": "## Translation: \n\"We also need three tomatoes and four eggs for the dinner.\"\n\n## Breakdown: \n- \"Vi\" - This means \"we,\" indicating the subject of the sentence.\n- \"behöver\" - This verb means \"need\" and is used to express necessity.\n- \"också\" - This adverb means \"also,\" signifying an addition to previously mentioned needs.\n- \"tre\" - This is the number \"three,\" quantifying the following noun.\n- \"tomater\" - The plural noun for \"tomatoes,\" which is important for understanding quantity.\n- \"och\" - This conjunction means \"and,\" connecting two items in the list.\n- \"fyra\" - This number means \"four,\" quantifying the next noun.\n- \"ägg\" - This is the plural noun for \"eggs.\"\n- \"till\" - This preposition translates to \"for\" in this context, indicating purpose or use.\n- \"middagen\" - Meaning \"the dinner,\" it’s in the definite form, showing it is a specific meal.\n\n## General Notes:\nThe sentence uses the definite form \"middagen\" which suggests a specific dinner, possibly one that has been already mentioned or is understood from context. The structure is straightforward, making it a good example of expressing needs in Swedish.\n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Vi behöver även tre tomater och fyra ägg för middagen.\"\nThis rewritten version uses \"även\" instead of \"också\" for \"also.\" While both words serve the same purpose, \"även\" can be slightly more formal. Additionally, \"för middagen\" omits the definite article \"till\" which is a more common way to express \"for dinner\" in casual conversation.",
    "momifyouha-b893": "## Translation\n\"If you have enough coins, you can buy something for yourself.\"\n\n## Breakdown\n- \"Om\" - \"If\": A conjunction used to introduce a conditional clause.\n- \"det\" - \"it\": A pronoun that refers to the situation or condition being described.\n- \"blir\" - \"becomes\": A verb in the present tense, indicating a change or result.\n- \"mynt\" - \"coins\": A noun referring to small currency pieces; plural form.\n- \"över\" - \"left/remaining\": An adverb meaning what is left after something is used or spent.\n- \"då\" - \"then\": An adverb used to indicate a consequence or result.\n- \"kan\" - \"can\": A modal verb expressing ability or possibility.\n- \"du\" - \"you\": A pronoun addressing the listener.\n- \"köpa\" - \"buy\": An infinitive verb meaning to purchase something.\n- \"något\" - \"something\": An indefinite pronoun referring to an unspecified item.\n- \"till\" - \"for\": A preposition indicating the purpose or recipient of the action.\n- \"dig själv\" - \"yourself\": A reflexive pronoun emphasizing that the action is for one’s own benefit.\n\n## General Notes\nThe sentence structure follows standard Swedish conditional phrasing with \"Om\" introducing the condition. The use of \"mynt\" instead of a more generic term for money indicates that only coins are considered here. The phrase \"till dig själv\" emphasizes personal enjoyment or benefit, which is common in colloquial Swedish.\n\n## Rewrite\n\"Om du har tillräckligt med mynt kan du köpa något för dig själv.\"\nThis version uses \"har tillräckligt med\" meaning \"have enough\" rather than \"blir\" (becomes) to directly state the condition of having enough coins. The meaning remains the same, but the focus shifts from the outcome of having coins to the possession of enough coins necessary for buying something.",
    "whenyouarr-5260": "## Translation:\n\"When you arrive near the fruits and vegetables, you recognize someone.\"\n\n## Breakdown:\n- \"När du kommer dit\" - \"When you arrive there\"\n  - \"När\" means \"when.\" \n  - \"du\" means \"you.\" \n  - \"kommer\" is the conjugated form of \"komma,\" meaning \"to come\" or \"to arrive.\" \n  - \"dit\" means \"there,\" indicating a direction or location.\n  \n- \"och närmar dig\" - \"and approach\"\n  - \"och\" means \"and.\"\n  - \"närmar\" is the conjugated form of \"närma,\" meaning \"to approach\" or \"to get closer.\"\n  - \"dig\" is the reflexive pronoun \"yourself.\" \n\n- \"frukt och grönsaksståndet\" - \"the fruits and vegetables stand\"\n  - \"frukt\" means \"fruit.\"\n  - \"och\" means \"and.\"\n  - \"grönsaksståndet\" is \"the vegetable stand,\" where \"grönsak\" means \"vegetable,\" and \"stånd\" means \"stand\" or \"stall,\" with \"-et\" being a definite article suffix.\n\n- \"känner du igen någon\" - \"you recognize someone\"\n  - \"känner\" is the conjugated form of \"kenna,\" meaning \"to know\" or \"to recognize.\"\n  - \"du\" means \"you.\" \n  - \"igen\" means \"again\" or \"back,\" and is used here to indicate recognition.\n  - \"någon\" means \"someone.\"\n\n## General Notes:\nThe sentence structure follows a typical Swedish word order where the subordinate clauses (\"När du kommer dit\" and \"närmar dig\") precede the main clause (\"känner du igen någon\"). The verb \"känna igen\" is a phrasal verb that uniquely conveys the act of recognizing someone, differing from just knowing someone.\n\n## Rewrite:\n\"Jag känner igen någon när jag kommer dit till frukt- och grönsaksståndet.\"\n\nThis rewritten version translates to \"I recognize someone when I arrive there at the fruit and vegetable stand.\" The differences lie in the subject (\"jag\" - \"I\") and the placement of the phrases, emphasizing the speaker's personal experience rather than a general statement.",
    "teachergre-19ab": "## Translation:  \n\"Great! I love apples too. I'm going to make apple sauce.\"\n\n## Breakdown:  \n- \"Toppen!\" - An informal expression meaning \"Great!\" or \"Awesome!\" often used to express enthusiasm.\n- \"Jag är också förtjust i äpplen.\" - \"Jag\" means \"I.\" \"är\" is the present tense of \"to be.\" \"också\" means \"also.\" \"förtjust i\" translates to \"fond of\" or \"in love with,\" indicating a strong liking. \"äpplen\" is the plural form of \"apple.\"\n- \"Jag ska göra äppelmos.\" - \"ska\" indicates future intention or plans, similar to \"going to.\" \"göra\" means \"make.\" \"äppelmos\" translates to \"apple sauce,\" a commonly made dish in Sweden.\n\n## General Notes:  \nThe use of \"förtjust i\" conveys a deeper affection than simply saying \"gilla,\" meaning \"like.\" Additionally, the phrase \"Jag ska\" is a common way to express future actions in Swedish. The exclamation \"Toppen!\" is informal and reflects casual conversation, making this sentence suitable for familiar contexts.\n\n## Rewrite:  \n\"Fantastiskt! Jag älskar äpplen också. Jag planerar att göra äppelmos.\"  \nThis alternative employs \"Fantastiskt,\" which means \"Fantastic!\" and \"älskar,\" meaning \"love,\" suggesting a stronger emotional connection than \"förtjust i.\" \"Planerar att\" translates to \"plan to\" instead of \"ska,\" emphasizing intention with a slightly different nuance.",
    "teachersee-ef56": "## Translation\n\"See you later! I'll stay a bit on the square to listen to the music.\"\n\n## Breakdown\n- **Vi ses later**: \"We see each other later.\" Here, \"vi\" means \"we,\" and \"ses\" is a reflexive verb meaning \"to see each other.\" The expression is a common way to say goodbye.\n- **Jag tänker**: \"I think\" or \"I'm planning to.\" \"Jag\" means \"I,\" and \"tänker\" is the present tense form of \"tänka,\" which can mean \"to think\" or \"to plan.\"\n- **stanna här**: \"stay here.\" \"stanna\" means \"to stay,\" and \"här\" means \"here.\"\n- **på torget**: \"on the square.\" \"på\" means \"on,\" and \"torget\" is the definite form of \"torg,\" meaning \"square.\"\n- **lite**: \"a bit\" or \"a little.\" It's an adverb indicating a small amount or duration.\n- **och**: \"and.\" A conjunction used to connect phrases.\n- **lyssna till musiken**: \"to listen to the music.\" \"lyssna\" means \"to listen,\" \"till\" suggests direction (\"to\"), and \"musiken\" is the definite form of \"musik,\" meaning \"the music.\"\n\n## General Notes\nThe phrase \"Vi ses senare!\" is informal and commonly used among friends and acquaintances. The structure \"tänker stanna\" indicates intention, suggesting the speaker has thought about their decision. The use of \"lite\" emphasizes a casual tone, making the sentence feel relaxed and informal.\n\n## Rewrite\n\"Vi ses snart! Jag ska stanna här på torget en stund och lyssna på musiken.\"\n\nThis rewrite uses \"snart\" instead of \"senare,\" which means \"soon\" instead of \"later.\" Additionally, \"jag ska\" implies a stronger intention or obligation compared to \"jag tänker.\" \"En stund\" means \"for a while,\" providing a slightly different nuance about the intended duration of the stay. Lastly, \"lyssna på musiken\" changes \"till\" to \"på,\" which is the more common preposition used with \"lyssna\" in this context."
