# Overview

LingoStories is an open project, and we welcome contributions from anyone.
Pretty much any kind of contribution is welcome. Focus on the things you can do
well, and rely on other people for the rest. Even if you don't have time to contribute,
giving feedback is very valuable. Please [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/SEefvsutca)
for feedback and discussions.


The following skills would be particularly appreciated:

* **Teaching**. If you're a language teacher, your feedback is precious. You may
  review the texts, give feedback on our approach, or request features that
  would make LingoStories more useful to students or other teachers.

* **Writing**. To provide more content on the website, we need people to help
  write the stories. Writing a full story is a significant work, but smaller
  contributions are also welcome: write a high-level scenario, help write some
  scenes or dialogues, or review the texts.

* **Translation**. If you speak fluently other languages, you can help translate
  the stories. Some translators have limited free time, so it's always useful to
  have more than one translator per language (this means you can volunteer, even
  if your language is already on the website).

* **Illustration**. We currently rely on generative AI to generate images. It
  would be nice to have actual artists to take care of the illustrations. Reach out
  if you're interested, we will of course credit you and link to your portfolio.

* **Game Design**. The current stories are relatively basic, but they could be
  designed more like adventure video games, and integrate more gameplay
  elements.

* **Programming**. There are always more things to do and polish.

# Giving Feedback

Giving feedback is very valuable. People often underestimate how impactful it is.

* Report any issues you encounter. It's likely that other people will have the same
  issues, and fixing them will improve the experience for everyone.
* Suggest new features. Many features of LingoStories exist because they were
  suggested by users.
* Suggest new stories. If you have ideas, share them, it can inspire others to actually write the story.
* Feedback is a source of motivation for the people working on the project. ❤️

There are two main channels to give feedback:
* the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SEefvsutca);
* the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/laurentlb/lingostories/issues)


# Writing

* Stories are written in English and then translated to other languages. The reference is the English version.
* You can first write a summary or a draft on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/),
  as it is convenient for sharing, collaborating and getting quick feedback.
* The [writing guide](./writing.html) contains the full guidelines.

    - This can be intimidating at the beginning, but don't worry, there are people ready to help you!


# Translation

Ask on Discord if you'd like to write or fix translations. We use a shared
spreadsheet to write the translations. They are later converted to .json for the
website.
