**LingoStories - Contributing**

# Overview

Pretty much any kind of contribution is welcome. Focus on the things you can do
well, and rely on other people for the rest.

The following skills would be particularly appreciated:

* **Teaching**. If you're a language teacher, your feedback is precious. You may
  review the texts, give feedback on our approach, or request features that
  would make LingoStories more useful to students or other teachers.

* **Writing**. To provide more content on the website, we need people to help
  write the stories. Writing a full story is a significant work, but smaller
  contributions are also welcome: write a high-level scenario, help write some
  scenes or dialogues, or review the texts.

* **Translation**. If you speak fluently other languages, you can help translate
  the stories. Some translators have limited free time, so it's always useful to
  have more than one translator per language (this means you can volunteer, even
  if your language is already on the website).

* **Illustration**. We currently rely on generative AI to generate images. It
  would be nice to have actual artists to take care of the illustrations.

* **Game Design**. The current stories are relatively basic, but they could be
  designed more like adventure video games, and integrate more gameplay
  elements.

* **Programming**. There are always more things to do and polish.

# Writing

## Guidelines

* The source of truth for the stories is the English version.
* The story should be suitable and appealing for the general audience worldwide.
* Prefer vocabulary that is common in everyday life.
* Choose a [CEFR level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels)
  and write the story accordingly.
   * See this [reference](https://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reference.php)
     sheet for vocabulary.
   * See [lingua.com](https://lingua.com/english/reading/) for text examples.
   * But don't worry too much --- it's fine to expose learners to new words and
     new grammar rules that might not know yet.
* Avoid cultural references and country-specific biases that might not be
  relevant to people in other countries.
* Avoid play-on-words and things that can be hard to translate.

## Tooling

We first write and discuss stories using [Google
Docs](https://docs.google.com/), which is convenient for sharing, collaborating
and getting quick feedback.

Later, stories are converted to [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink). Ink can be
intimidating at the beginning, but don't worry, we have people to help you! You can find .ink files of our [stories on GitHub](https://github.com/laurentlb/lingostories/tree/main/stories).

# Translation

Ask on Discord if you'd like to write or fix translations. We use a shared
spreadsheet to write the translations. They are later converted to .json for the
website.
